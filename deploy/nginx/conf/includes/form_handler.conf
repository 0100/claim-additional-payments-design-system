# Handle form submissions from examples that contain forms by redirecting them
# back to the referring example. This relies on form examples within the design
# system being set up to POST to `/form-handler`.
#
# If for whatever reason there is no referrer, then redirect to the homepage
# instead.
#
# Note that this will only work when deployed to CloudFoundry â€“ Netlify does not
# use this config at all.
