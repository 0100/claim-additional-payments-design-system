The GOV.UK Design System is currently in beta. The Design System team will be developing these contribution guidelines based on user research over the coming months.

## Discussing styles, components and patterns

You can discuss the existing styles, components and patterns in the Design System, or ones being developed, by commenting on issues in the [community backlog](/design-system/community/backlog). Alternatively, you can email [govuk-design-system-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto: govuk-design-system-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

For example, you can:

- ask questions about a style, component or pattern
- answer questions from other contributors
- share examples or demos of a style, component or pattern
- share research relating to a style, component or pattern

## Proposing new styles, components or patterns

If you have an idea for a new style, component or pattern you can propose it by [raising an issue](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/new) or emailing the Design System team at [govuk-design-system-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto: govuk-design-system-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

## Developing components and patterns

If there’s something you’d be interested in working on, comment on its issue or email the Design System team at [govuk-design-system-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto: govuk-design-system-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

If you're writing code, please follow the [GOV.UK Frontend coding standards](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#conventions-to-follow).

## Design System criteria

To help ensure that the contents of the GOV.UK Design System are of a high quality and meet user needs, all components and patterns must meet the following criteria.

## New proposals

To be considered for inclusion in the GOV.UK Design System, components and patterns must be:


{{ govukTable({
  head: [
    {
      text: "Criteria"
    },
    {
      text: "Description"
    }
  ],
  rows: [
    [
      {
        text: "Useful"
      },
      {
        text: "It addresses a user need that’s shared by multiple services or products."
      }
    ],
    [
      {
        text: "Unique"
      },
      {
        text: "It doesn’t duplicate something which already exists in the GOV.UK Design System, unless it’s intended to replace it."
      }
    ]
  ]
}) }}


The [working group](/design-system/community/working-group) will review all proposals in the [community backlog](/design-system/community/backlog) to check they meet these criteria, before they are agreed.

## Before publication

Before new components and patterns are published into the GOV.UK Design System, the working group will review them again to make sure that they are:

{{ govukTable({
  head: [
    {
      text: "Criteria"
    },
    {
      text: "Description"
    }
  ],
  rows: [
    [
      {
        text: "Usable"
      },
      {
        text: "It’s been tested and shown to work with a representative sample of users, including those with disabilities."
      }
    ],
    [
      {
        text: "Consistent"
      },
      {
        text: "It uses existing styles and components in the GOV.UK Design System where relevant."
      }
    ],
    [
      {
        text: "Versatile"
      },
      {
        text: "It can be easily applied in different contexts."
      }
    ],
    [
      {
        text: "Coded"
      },
      {
        text: "Components are ready to merge in GOV.UK Frontend."
      }
    ],
    [
      {
        text: "Tested"
      },
      {
        html: "It’s been tested and shown to work with a range of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/designing-for-different-browsers-and-devices\">browsers, assistive technologies and devices</a>."
      }
    ],
    [
      {
        text: "Considered"
      },
      {
        text: "There are no obvious political, security or ethical implications."
      }
    ]
  ]
}) }}
