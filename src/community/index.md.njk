# Community

The GOV.UK Design System is for everyone, with a strong community sitting behind it. It brings together the latest research, design and development from across government to make it sure it’s representative and relevant for its users. 

Find out [how to contribute](contribute), or see what people are currently working on in the [community backlog](backlog). 

You can also learn how the cross-government [Design System working group](working-group) helps to quality assure the styles, components and patterns you’ll find here.
