# Accessibility

The GOV.UK Design System team works hard to ensure that this Design System and GOV.UK Frontend, the codebase it uses, are accessible.

This Design System and GOV.UK Frontend were last tested for accessibility in May 2019. The test was carried out by accessibility specialists [DAC (Digital Accessibility Centre)](https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/) against level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1.

You can see the [issues DAC raised and what we fixed](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3Aalphagov+label%3A%22audit%3A+may-2019%22+).

We know there are a small number of accessibility issues that need to be resolved. You can see [a list of outstanding issues](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3Aalphagov+label%3A%22audit%3A+may-2019%22+is%3Aopen).

Where possible, the team aims to research components and patterns with a representative range of users, including those with disabilities. 

It also tests components to ensure they work with a broad range of [browsers, devices and assistive technologies](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend#assistive-technology-support).

## Making your service accessible

While the GOV.UK Design System team takes steps to ensure the Design System is as accessible as possible by default, this does not remove the need for contextual research. 

Using GOV.UK Frontend will not automatically mean you meet level AA of WCAG 2.1. You will still need to make sure your service as a whole meets accessibility requirements.

You must research styles, components and patterns as part of your service to ensure that they are accessible in context.  

Find out what you need to do to [make your service accessible](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction) in the GOV.UK Service Manual.

## If you are not using the GOV.UK Design System and GOV.UK Frontend

The Design System and Frontend were introduced in June 2018 to replace the following deprecated codebases:

- GOV.UK Elements
- GOV.UK Frontend Toolkit
- GOV.UK Template

The GOV.UK Design System team no longer supports these products and will not be making updates to help them meet level AA of WCAG 2.1. 

If you are using these products, itâ€™s recommended that you begin [updating your service now to use the Design System and Frontend](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started/updating-your-code/).

Doing this will allow you to update your service in a much more manageable way, than waiting to update straight to Frontend v.3.0.0.

If you would like to start using the Design System and Frontend, read guidance on [how to get started](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started/).

The GOV.UK Design System team will keep this page up to date with updates and when the new version of Frontend is available.

If you have any questions in the meantime, [get in touch](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-in-touch/).
