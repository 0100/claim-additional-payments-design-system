Avoid unnecessary decoration. Only use images if there’s a real user need.

## Aspect ratio

### Photography

The aspect ratio for photographs should be 3:2.

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "images", example: "default", html: false, open: false, size: "l"}) }}


### Illustrations or representative imagery

If your image represents something physical, such as a letter, document or credit card you should use the aspect ratio of that item.

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "images", example: "representative", html: false, open: false, size: "l"}) }}


## Alt text

All images must have alt text. This is a description of an image that is read out by screen readers or is displayed if an image does not load or images have been switched off. The description tells people what information the image provides.

Alt text must:

- describe the content and function of the image
- be specific, meaningful and concise
- use normal punctuation and end with a full stop

Do not:

- include the name of the photographer or person who created the image
- start with ‘Image of’, ‘Graphic of’ or ‘Photo of’
- repeat information from the page
- include extra information not on the page

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "images", example: "alt-text", html: true, open: true, size: "l"}) }}

So an image will be ignored by screen readers, use `alt=""` if it is:

- decorative and does not include important content
- an icon that has a text label
- part of a link

Avoid images that contain text, especially PNGs and JPGs because the text becomes unreadable when the user zooms in. If the image does contain text, use SVG because it remains readable when the user zooms in. The alt should be the same as the text displayed in the image.

If the image needs a detailed description, for example a graph or pie chart, include it in the content of the screen because it will help everyone. Use the `aria-describedby` attribute to connect the image and the description for screen reader users.
