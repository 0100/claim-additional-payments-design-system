Avoid unnecessary decoration - only use images if thereâ€™s a real user need.

## Aspect ratio

### Photography

The aspect ratio for photographs should be 3:2.

{{ example({group: 'styles', item: 'images', example: 'default', html: false, open: false}) }}


### Illustrations or representative imagery

If your image represents something in the real world, such as a letter, document or credit card you should use the aspect ratio of that item.

{{ example({group: 'styles', item: 'images', example: 'representative', html: false, open: false}) }}

## Alt text

All images should have associated alt text. This helps describe the image to users who are unable to see it.

If your image is purely decorative, where a description would be confusing in context of the page, it should be marked to be ignored by screen readers. You should include a null alt tag `alt=""`.

{{ example({group: 'styles', item: 'images', example: 'alt-text', html: true, open: true}) }}
