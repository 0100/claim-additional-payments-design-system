## Using media query mixins

All of the components supplied with GOV.UK Frontend contain the appropriate styles for different size screens.

If you are creating your own components or need to change elements of your page at different screen sizes you can use the media query mixins in your SCSS file.

The media query mixin can be used in a number of different ways but the most common will be to define styles based on the existing breakpoints, mobile, tablet and desktop.

The mixin translates min-width and max-width into `$from` and `$until`. For example if you wanted a style to apply from tablet you can use `$from: tablet`. If you wanted a style to apply on mobile and desktop but stop at desktop you could use `$until: desktop`.

Hereâ€™s an example of an element that has a colour of `green`, that changes to `red` from the tablet breakpoint.

```
.element {
  color: green;
  
  @include govuk-media-query($from: tablet) {
    color: red;
  }
} 
```

### Examples of from and until
```
.element {
  @include govuk-media-query($from: mobile) {
    color: red;
  }
  @include govuk-media-query($until: tablet) {
    color: blue;
  }
  @include govuk-media-query($from: tablet) {
    color: yellow;
  }
  @include govuk-media-query($until: desktop) {
    color: aqua;
  }
  @include govuk-media-query($from: desktop) {
    color: orange;
  }
}
```

### Other uses

You can define the breakpoint behaviour in some other ways if needed.

#### Breakpont shorthand

You can use `mobile, tablet, desktop` to apply styles explicitly to the boundaries of each breakpoint. For example, if you want a style to apply to mobile and tablet you can do so like this.

```
.element {
  @include govuk-media-query(mobile, tablet) {
    color: green;
  }
}
```

#### Specific units

You can add your own minor breakpoints by specifiying specific widths. For example, 

```
.element {
  @include govuk-media-query(950px) {
    color: green;
  }
}
```

#### Other media query options

If you want to make use of some of the default `@media` rules, you can do so using `$and` like this:

```
.element {
  @include govuk-media-query($from: tablet, $and: '(orientation: landscape)') {
    color: teal;
  }
}
```
