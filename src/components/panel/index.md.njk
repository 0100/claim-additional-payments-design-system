The Panel component is a visible container used on confirmation or results pages to highlight important content.

## When to use this component

Use the Panel component to display important information when a transaction has been completed.

In most cases, the Panel component is used on [Confirmation pages](Link to confirmation page pattern), to tell the user they have successfully completed the transaction.



You can also use the Panel component in services that give users instant results, such as confirming the MOT status of a vehicle, to highlight the most important information on the page.

For example:



### When not to use

Don’t use the Panel component to highlight important information within body content. In this instance you should use the ‘Inset text’ component instead.

## How it works

There are two ways to use the Panel component. You can use HTML or, if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the GOV.UK Prototype Kit, you can use the Panel macro.
