The Breadcrumbs component helps users to understand where they are within a website’s structure and move between levels.

{{ example({group: 'components', item: 'breadcrumbs', example: 'default', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

## When to use this component

Use the Breadcrumbs component when you need to help users understand and move between the multiple levels of a  website.

### When not to use this component

Don’t use the Breadcrumbs component on websites with a flat structure, or to show progress through a linear journey or transaction.

If you’re using other navigational devices on the page, such as a sidebar, consider whether your users need the additional guidance of breadcrumbs.

## How it works

The Breadcrumbs component should include the user’s current page, which should be visually different from the other pages linked to in the breadcrumb.

There are 2 ways to use the Breadcrumbs component. You can use HTML or, if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the GOV.UK Prototype Kit, you can use the Breadcrumbs macro.

{{ example({group: 'components', item: 'breadcrumbs', example: 'default', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: true}) }}
