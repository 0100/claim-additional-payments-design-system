Use the fieldset component to group related form inputs.

## When to use this component

Use the fieldset component when you need to show a relationship between multiple form inputs.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "fieldset", example: "address-group", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "xl"}) }}

If you’re using the examples or macros for [radios](../radios), [checkboxes](../checkboxes) or [date input](../date-input), the fieldset will already be included.

## How it works

The first element inside a fieldset must be a `legend` which describes the group of inputs. This could be a question, such as ‘What is your current address?’ or a statement like ‘Personal details’.

Read more about [why and how to set legends as headings](../../get-started/labels-legends-headings).

{{ example({group: "components", item: "fieldset", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

Include any general help text which is important for filling in the form and cannot be written as [hint text](../../components/text-input#using-hint-text) in the legend, but try to keep it as concise as possible.
