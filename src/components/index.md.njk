Components are re-usable parts of the user interface. They are named chunks of
code that have been made to support a variety of applications. They are often
associated with specific [patterns](../patterns) when used in a
particular context.

On the most part, if you are using the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit-beta.herokuapp.com) or
have [GOV.UK Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend)
included in your build, the coded examples provided should render exactly as
they do inside the design system.
