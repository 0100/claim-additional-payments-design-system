## When to use this component

Use the button component to help users carry out an action on a GOV.UK page like starting an application or saving their information.

## How it works

Write button text in sentence case, describing the action it performs. For example:

- ‘Start now’ at the [start of the service](/patterns/start-pages/)
- ‘Sign in’ to an account a user has already created
- ‘Continue’ when the service does not save a user’s information
- ‘Save and continue’ when the service does save a user’s information
- ‘Save and come back later’ when a user can save their information and come back later
- ‘Add another’ to add another item to a list or group
- ‘Pay’ to make a payment
- ‘Confirm and send’ on a [check answers](/patterns/check-answers/) page that does not have any legal content a user must agree to
- ‘Accept and send’ on a [check answers](/patterns/check-answers/) page that has legal content a user must agree to
- ‘Sign out’ when a user is signed in to an account

You may need to include more or different words to better describe the action. For example, ‘Add another address’ and ‘Accept and claim a tax refund’.

Align the primary action button to the left edge of your form.

There are 2 ways to use the button component. You can use HTML or, if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com), you can use the Nunjucks macro.

### Start buttons

Use a start button as the main call to action on your service’s start page.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "button", example: "start", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

### Disabled buttons

Disabled buttons have poor contrast and can confuse some users, so avoid them if&nbsp;possible.

Only use disabled buttons if research shows it makes the user interface easier to&nbsp;understand.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "button", example: "disabled", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}
