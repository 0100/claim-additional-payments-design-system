This guide explains how to create prototypes using the GOV.UK Design System and GOV.UK Prototype Kit.

## Before you start

To make prototypes using the new Design System you will need to download and install a new version of the GOV.UK Prototype Kit. The installation process is the same as for the current version.

* [Download the new version of the GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit-beta.herokuapp.com/)
* [Follow these installation instructions](https://govuk-prototype-kit-beta.herokuapp.com/docs/install/introduction)

The rest of the guide assumes that you are familar with the GOV.UK Prototype Kit.

## Using the new Prototype Kit

The new version of the Prototype Kit is identical to the one you may have used before except that it uses our new frontend framework, GOV.UK Frontend.

This means that any code that you copy across from old prototypes will not display correctly.
Instead, you should use the examples from the GOV.UK Design System.

## Styling content

The GOV.UK Design System provides lots of new CSS classes for styling content. The idea is that you will rarely need to write your own Sass or CSS.

The class names follow the [BEM naming convention](https://en.bem.info/methodology/). This can look a bit daunting at first, but it makes for more robust and easier to maintain code. 

There are 2 ways to apply styles to content.

### Using a prose scope wrapper

To give basic HTML elements a default GOV.UK style, wrap them in a ‘prose-scope’ div, like this: 

{{ example({group: 'styles', item: 'typography', example: 'prose-scope', html: true, open: true}) }}

### Styling individual elements

If you need more control you should add classes to the individual elements instead of using prose-scope. Avoid styling individual elements within a prose scope wrapper.

{{ example({group: 'styles', item: 'typography', example: 'captions', html: true, open: true}) }}

Explore the [Styles section of the Design System](/styles/) to see what classes are available. 

## Using components

Components are reusable user interface elements. The components in the Design System are designed to be accessible and responsive. 

There are 2 ways to use components. 

You can either use the component HTML or a Nunjucks Macro. 

Copy the code into your prototype where you want the component to appear.

You can get the code from the HTML or Nunjucks tabs below any examples:

{{ example({group: 'components', item: 'button', example: 'default', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

### Using Nunjucks macros

A Nunjucks macro is a simple template that generates more complex HTML.

Nunjucks macros save you time by managing repetative or error-prone tasks, 
like linking form labels to their controls.

Nunjucks macros also make it easier to keep your prototypes up-to-date. 
You can run a command to update component code instead of having to manually update your HTML.

When using Nunjucks macros in the Prototype Kit:

* omit the first line that starts with "{% raw %}{% from {% endraw %}...".
* save and preview regularly to check that the macro is working
