## When to use this pattern

Follow this pattern when you need users to provide their bank details so that:

- you can pay them 
- they can pay by Direct Debit

If your service lets users set up Direct Debit payments, first check if you can use [GOV.UK Pay](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/direct-debit/). If you do use this pattern, you’ll need to ask whether the user is authorised to set up the Direct Debit.

## How it works

Make it as easy as possible for users to enter their bank details.

If your payment service provider needs additional information include those as extra fields. Remove fields that are not needed.

### Bank accounts or building society accounts

Do not ask users if they have a bank account or building society account as not all users know this.

If your service only accommodates bank accounts, remove building society from the content and do not ask for a roll number.

### Asking for building society roll numbers

Roll numbers are only used by some building societies for certain types of account, so make this field optional. 

However, it is required when a user’s account has one. This is why the label says ‘(if you have one)’.

### Allow different formats for the sort code

Let users enter their sort code in whatever format is familiar to them. Allow additional spaces, hyphens and dashes.

Use one input for the sort code. It’s quicker to use and does not need multiple input labels that might be unclear.

### Use a branching question if users can choose how to pay or get paid

Not everyone has a bank account or wants to share their account details online.

Let users choose to pay or get paid by an alternative method if needed.

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "bank-details", example: "branch", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "xl"}) }}

### International bank account details

If you expect your users to have a non-UK bank account, give them an option to select this.

International bank accounts require different fields to sort code and account number.

Most countries need the IBAN and BIC, sometimes known as the SWIFT code.

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "bank-details", example: "international", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "xl"}) }}

Different countries ask for different details. Only show fields that relate to the user's country.

### Error messages

Error messages should be styled like this:

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "bank-details", example: "error", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "xl"}) }}

Make sure errors follow the guidance in [error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/) and have specific error messages for specific error states.

#### If the name on the account is empty

Enter the name on the account

#### If the sort code is empty

Enter a sort code

#### If the sort code is not in the correct format

Enter a valid sort code like 404771

#### If the account number is empty

Enter an account number

#### If the account number is not in the correct format

Enter a valid account number like 61733445

#### If the account number is too long or too short

Account number must be between 6 and 8 digits

#### If the building society roll number is too long

Building society roll number must be between 1 to 18 characters

#### If the building society roll number uses characters that are not allowed

Building society roll number must only include letters a to z, numbers, hyphens, spaces and periods.

## Research on this pattern

This pattern was originally contributed by a team at the Ministry of Justice. 

It's based on the one used in GOV.UK Pay and other variations across government including the following.

**Department for work and pensions**<br>Universal Credit<br>
Get jobseeker’s Allowance<br>
Get your state pension

**HM Revenue & Customs**<br>
Register your anti-money laundering supervision<br>
Tax-free childcare

**Office of the Public Guardian**<br>
Claim a power of attorney refund

**Ministry of Justice**<br>
Claim for costs of a child’s funeral

If you’ve used this pattern, get in touch to share your user research findings.

### Next steps

The team who developed this pattern only found one service, Claim power of attorney refund, that warns the user that the details will be hidden for their security.

But the GoCardless Direct Debit provider that GOV.UK Pay uses says to display the customer’s bank details back to them before submission.

More research is needed on whether bank details should be shown or not on a ‘Check your answers’ page, and how that affects this pattern.

More research is also needed on the best way to handle international bank accounts so that users are only asked for information that’s needed based on the location of their bank account.
