## When to use this pattern

Follow this pattern whenever you need to ask users questions within your service.

## How it works

Question pages must include a:

- back link
- page heading
- continue button

### Back link

Always include a [back link](../../components/back-link) on question pages.

Some users don’t trust browser ‘back’ buttons when they’re entering data. Add a back link to reassure users that it’s possible to go back and change previous answers.

The back link should be at the top of the page because users are most likely to want to go back when they first land on a page.

Make sure the back link takes users to the previous page and that it still works when JavaScript isn’t available.

### Page headings

Page headings can be statements or questions.

If you’re only asking for one piece of information on a page, make the question the page heading.

For example:

{{ example({group: 'patterns', item: 'question-pages', example: 'postcode', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: true}) }}

If you need to ask for multiple related things on a page, use a statement as the heading.

For example:

{{ example({group: 'patterns', item: 'question-pages', example: 'passport', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: true}) }}

Don’t duplicate the same page heading across multiple pages.

The page heading should relate specifically to the information being asked for on the current page, not any higher-level section the page is part of.

If you need to show the high-level section, you can use the `govuk-caption` style.

For example, ‘About you’:

{{ example({group: 'patterns', item: 'question-pages', example: 'section-headings', html: true, open: true}) }}

### Continue button

Make sure your ‘Continue’ button is:

- labelled ‘Continue’, not ‘Next’
- aligned to the left so users don’t miss it

### Using progress indicators

Start by testing your form without a progress indicator to see if it’s simple enough that users don’t need one.

Try improving the order, type or number of questions before adding a progress indicator. If people still have difficulty, try adding a simple step or question indicator like this one.

{{ example({group: 'patterns', item: 'fill-in-a-form', example: 'progress', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: true}) }}

Only include the total number of questions if you can do so reliably. As the user moves through the form, make sure the indicator updates to tell them which question they are on and the total number remaining.

Don't use progress indicators that do all of the following:

- show all questions at once
- allow navigation to previous questions
- show the current question

An example of this looks like:

These can be problematic because they:

- are often not noticed
- take up lots of space
- don’t scale well on small screens
- can distract and confuse some users
- make it hard to write good labels for the steps
- make it hard to handle conditional sections

A number of GOV.UK services have removed this style of progress indicator without any negative effects.
Read a blog post about [how the Carer’s Allowance team removed a 12-step progress indicator](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2014/07/07/do-less-problems-as-shared-spaces/) with no effect on completion rates or times.

### Asking users questions

When asking users questions, you should:

- explain why they’ll be asked questions
- order questions to give most people the quickest result
- only ask questions that they will be able to answer
- avoid asking for information that you can find in government data
- allow users to answer ‘I don’t know’ or ‘I’m not sure’ if they are valid responses
- translate supporting documents into clear questions on the page &ndash; don’t force users to go away and read background information before they can give an answer
