Before using this pattern, consider whether you need to ask for this information and make sure you have permission from your organisation to do so.

Only collect users’ ethnic groups if you are going to use the data, for example, as part of your organisation’s equality monitoring.

Read guidance about [collecting personal information](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/collecting-personal-information-from-users) in the GOV.UK Service Manual.

![‘Ethnic group’ flow diagram. Contains an initial page asking “What is your ethnic group?” with 6 options. 5 of the options lead to separate follow-up pages asking ”Which one best describes your background?” for Asian, Black, Mixed, White, or Other. The 6th option is “Prefer not to say”, which exits the flow.](ethnic-group-flow.png)

## When to use this pattern

Follow this pattern if you need to ask users in the UK for their ethnic group.

## How it works

When asking for users’ ethnic groups:

- use the same wording of the question as shown in this pattern
- use the exact ethnic group categories shown in this pattern, which are from the most recent census in England
- let users specify a different ethnic group from those provided
- make the question optional
- tell users how their data will be used
- ensure the data is used and stored in line with data protection rules

### Ask for ethnic groups in 2 steps

ONS research found that presenting all of the ethnic group options on a single page caused some users to try and select more than 1 option. Splitting the question across 2 pages solved this problem across multiple testing rounds with more than 300 users.

Ask users for their broad ethnic group first of all.

From there, direct them to a second page where they can choose a specific ethnic background within their broad ethnic group.

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "ethnic-group", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

#### Asian or Asian British

Users who select ‘Asian or Asian British’ should see this page.

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "ethnic-group", example: "asian", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

#### Black, African, Black British or Carribean

Users who select ‘Black, African, Black British or Carribean’ should see this page.

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "ethnic-group", example: "black", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

#### Mixed or multiple ethnic groups

Users who select ‘Mixed or multiple ethnic groups’ should see this page.

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "ethnic-group", example: "mixed", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

#### White

Users who select ‘White’ should see this page.

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "ethnic-group", example: "white", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

#### Another ethnic group

Users who select ‘Another ethnic group’ should see this page.

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "ethnic-group", example: "other", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

### Let users specify a different ethnic group from those provided

You should provide an option for users to enter a different ethnic group in case theirs is not covered in the options given. This can also help to inform future changes to the options, to reflect how users describe their ethnic groups.

### Accommodate regional differences

The ethnic groups used in this pattern are for services in England. Different categories are used in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

If your service covers more than 1 region, you should accommodate these differences in your design. For example, by changing the ethnic groups shown depending on whether the user is based in [England](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/ethnicity/#englandhttps://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/ethnicity/#england), [Wales](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/ethnicity/#wales-), [Scotland](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/ethnicity/#scotland) or [Northern Ireland](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/ethnicity/#northern-ireland).

Where this isn’t possible, use the English categories.

### Make the question optional

Always give users the option not to give their ethnicity unless you cannot deliver your service without it.

The best way to do this is to include a step asking if users are willing to give their ethnic group. To help users decide how to answer, you should clearly explain how you will use the data.

Be as specific as possible, for example: ‘we use this information to make sure we’re giving equal opportunities to all candidates’.

### Asking for other protected characteristics

If you ask for other information which is not mandatory, such as gender/sex, consider how to ask for this alongside ethnicity.

In this case, you could ask a more generic initial question, such as “Will you answer a few more questions so we can monitor this service for equality?” Make sure you still explain how all the information will be used.

### Asking a user for someone else’s ethnic group

You should not normally ask users to give someone else’s ethnic group. This is because ethnicity is self-defined. There are some exceptions, for example, in the case of young children.

### Error messages

Error messages should be styled like this:

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "ethnic-group", example: "error", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "ethnic-group", example: "error-background", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}


### Data protection

Under the General Data Protection Regulation, there are different [rules around the use and storage of someone’s ethnic origin](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/special-category-data/ ).

## Research on this pattern

This pattern was originally contributed by the Race Disparity Unit.

The examples and guidance here are based on [examples of ways to ask about ethnic groups](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2019/01/29/researching-how-we-ask-users-about-their-ethnicity/) from a number of government services, and [research from the Office of National Statistics (ONS)](https://history.blog.gov.uk/2019/03/07/50-years-of-collecting-ethnicity-data/).

The Race Disparity Unit researched this pattern as part of a prototype. They carried out pop-up research with over 30 participants with different ethnic backgrounds.

Almost all participants answered the question quickly and easily, with no one backtracking to change their selection from the previous page.

5 of the participants used the text input provided to specify 'another' ethnicity than those provided, which validates the need for this option.

2 participants chose not to answer the question after a step was introduced asking whether users were willing to provide their ethnic group.

## Next steps

More research is needed to understand where to ask this question in a service.
