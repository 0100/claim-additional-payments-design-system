This pattern explains how to give users contact information within your service.

It does not give guidance on where on a page or in a service this information should be provided. You should carry out contextual user research to decide this.

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "contact-a-department-or-service-team", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "xl"}) }}

## When to use this pattern

Follow this pattern whenever you need to help users contact your team or department. Read about how and why to [set up user support in the GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/set-up-and-manage-user-support).

## How it works

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "contact-a-department-or-service-team", example: "all-contact-information", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "xl"}) }}

### Order contact channels consistently

List contact channels in the same order throughout your service.  This helps users to find what they need more easily.

Order contact details based on what research shows your users need, and what your service or department can best support.

### Social media

Include social media channels if users can contact you in this way. If you do this:

- list these channels last
- do not include a link to the social media sites you're using - read more about this in [GOV.UK’s external linking policy](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/links#linking-policy)
- tell users not to share personal information with you

### Write telephone numbers in the GOV.UK style

See the [GOV.UK style for writing telephone numbers](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#telephone-numbers).

### Explain any charges

Tell users if they might have to pay to use any of your contact channels.

For telephone call charges, link to the GOV.UK page on [call charges](https://www.gov.uk/call-charges).

Include the link after the contact channels list and opening hours.

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "contact-a-department-or-service-team", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "xl"}) }}

### Give opening hours

Follow the GOV.UK style guide format for [time ranges](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#times) and [date ranges](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#dates).

Explain any exceptions, like bank holidays, or days of the week when your opening hours are different.

For example, ‘Monday to Friday, 9am to midday and 2pm to 4:30pm (closed on bank holidays)’ or ‘24-hour service’.

### Tell users how long they’ll have to wait

Let users know up front when you will respond to them. This helps users choose which contact channel to use.

For example, say that you aim to respond to emails within 2 working days.

Or, if you’re using webchat or telephone, say how long you estimate it will take them to get to the front of the queue.

### Inset contact information

Use [inset text](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/inset-text/) to display contact information when you want to differentiate it from the content that surrounds it.

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "contact-a-department-or-service-team", example: "inset-contact-information", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "xl"}) }}

### Expanding contact information

If contact information is less important than other content on a page, you can enclose contact information inside the [details](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/details/) component to avoid distracting users.

For example, if you need to provide contact information at the bottom of a form page for users who need help completing the form.

Only do this when there’s a lot of contact information to display. When there are only 1 or 2 lines, include the contact information within the body of the page.

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "contact-a-department-or-service-team", example: "expanding-contact-information", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "xl"}) }}

## Research on this pattern

This pattern was originally contributed by a team at the Government Digital Service (GDS).

The examples and guidance here are based on patterns used in the Legal Aid Agency (LAA) and Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS).

The team tested this pattern as part of a government campaign. They ran 2 rounds of research with 12 participants in total.

### Next steps

Research is needed to work out:

- if a different approach is needed for users who are signed into a service
- how to provide contact information to users who need urgent help
