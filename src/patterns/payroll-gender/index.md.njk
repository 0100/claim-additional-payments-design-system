## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern when you have to ask what someone's gender is in particular
dataset which only allows for binary options.

## When not to use this pattern

Do not use this pattern if there is any way the service can function without
this data.

This is a difficult question to answer because:

- Rich has reasons in his brain but now is not the right time to write them down.
- Bulled 2

### SOME H3

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Quisque nibh mauris,
sollicitudin quis efficitur non, porttitor sit amet massa. Integer tincidunt
massa venenatis arcu pulvinar molestie.

### Error messages

Error messages should be styled like this:

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "payroll-gender", example: "error-none-selected", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

Make sure errors follow the guidance in the GDS
[error message](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/)
and have specific error messages for specific error states.

## Research on this component

Reasearch on this is really hard so we had a good think when making it
